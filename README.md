# Property Listings Component

## Objective
Create a responsive React component that displays property listings in three main sections:

2. **Featured Listings Row**: Develop a horizontally scrollable row of cards as shown in Image 1 below.
3. **Detailed Listings Section**: Create a vertical list of detailed property cards as shown in Image 2 below.
